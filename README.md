# Bix Plasma Player (ALFA)

Bix Plasma Player is a modern plasmoid, a multimedia audio player integrated into KDE Plasma 6.1 or later. It does not require root access for installation and will be installed from the Plasmoids store. Although this is not a standalone app, it is designed to function like one.


This plasmoid is in an early stage of development, it is not yet usable. Please, if possible, support the development by donating
